		Unix / Linux fundamentals and shell scripting


1. Introduction to Unix/Linux
2. Features
3. Basic command to file/directory
4. file permissions
5. The Vi editor
6. Various filters
7. Shell Environment
8. Shell Scripting <===

				UNIX / GNU-LINUX

		microsoft calculator - GUI - source code is not open

		if the code is open to the world
		
				
	1. Portable in user point of view
	2. 100% secured system
			u 	g 	o 	+ 	r 	w	 x 
			user  group	other		read	write	execute

		execute permission CANNOT be BY DEFAULT

		IN WINDOWS -> CAN WE DISABLE THE EXECUTABLENESS OF AN EXECUTABLE FILE???


			IN UNIX/LINUX WE CAN REMOVE THE EXECUTABLENESS FROM A FILE

					chmod u-x   upload.sh

		
	3. by default a network based system
			windows NT
	
	4. Robust - ability to survive for many years

	5. multi user/multitasking/multiprocessing





	File commands


	The unix file system structure - international standard structure 
			


	top					/ <-- root directory (folder)
						|
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	|	|	|	|	|	|	|	|	|	|	|	
1	bin	/sbin	usr	etc	dev	home	var	proc	root	boot	lib
	20	15	|			|
		-----------------		amit
		|		|
2		bin		sbin
		400		70

amit has an access of /bin
priya has an access of /bin/  and /sbin
jack  has an access of /usr/bin -- 400 commands [ subject to white list ]
janet has an access of /usr/bin + /usr/sbin -- 470 commands
root user /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin - 505 commands
	1. / <---- (similar to MyComputer | This PC in windows )
			the root directory ( the slash directory )

	2. /root <-- this is the HOME directory for the unix admin [ the root user ]

			hey amit goto the /
			hey amit goto the /root

	3. /sbin	system binaries
	4. /home/amit	home directory  for amit
			/home contains the folders of all the users

			/export/abc/0/local/home/amit 

	5. /etc		editable text configuration 
				configure files from this folder to config the system/box

	6. /dev		device drivers inside this folder /devices on solaris os
			logical names to the physical devices
			C: D: E: in windows 
			we dont have drive letters in unix
			we HAVE names to the devices
				/dev/sda1   /dev/sda2

	7. /var		variable data/ logs/spools/buffers/jobs
	8. /proc	running processes are kept here [ managed here ]
	9. /boot	the image of the kernel is here
	10. /lib	libraries [ .dlls in windows ] .so [ shared objects ]
	11. /tmp	dumping ground for all the datafiles/temp files [ lost in reset ]
	12. /opt	similar to 'c:\program files' in windows - software are kept here
			/opt/java/jdk21/bin <-- javac
			/opt/oracle/db21/bin <--- sqlplus 
	13. /usr/bin	binaries at larger level
	14. /usr/sbin	system binaries at larget level
	15. /usr 	unix system resources
	16. /bin
